# Password Reset

A forgotten password can be reset on the D4H sign-in screen. Click on 'Forgotten your password?'. A reset link will be sent to you by email. This will also remind you of your username. If the email does not arrive, check your spam folder.

A password reset link is only valid for 24 hours after it is activated. If you have not actioned your password reset within 24 hours and the link is invalid, you will need to request a new link by following the steps outlined above.
