# Signing-in

### WEB APP

To gain access to your D4H account for the first time you need to ask the D4H administrator in your team to send you an 'invitation' from the system. You will receive an email with an activation link that will allow you to create your username and password and then sign in.  
  
This is how you will sign in for any of the below modules:

* [Personnel & Training](../../personnel-and-training/getting-started.md)
* [Equipment Management](../../equipment-management/getting-started.md)
* [Incident Reporting](../../incident-reporting/getting-started.md)

[D4H Personnel App](../../personnel-and-training/personnel-and-training-app/), [D4H Equipment App](../../equipment-management/equipment-management-app.md)

To sign into your D4H app, you will use the same username and password that you use to login to the web version. You will also need to select your D4H region.
