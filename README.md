# Introduction ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the D4H Knowledge Base. This is a repository for informational and support articles relating to our four products: Personnel & Training, Equipment Management, Incident Management, and Incident Reporting. If you are looking for a particular topic, use the search function in the top right. For general information, check out our guides below. 

At D4H, we donâ€™t simply support responders, we all are responders. The team at D4H come from a wide variety of response backgrounds from public safety through to corporate crisis and emergency management. We have a duty to innovate; to keep improving our software using the latest technologies available. We are regularly updating our software to meet the complex and ever-evolving needs of emergency response groups, so check back regularly for information on how to use these new features as they are added.
