# Introduction ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the D4H Knowledge Base. This is a repository for informational and support articles relating to our four products: [Personnel & Training](personnel-and-training/getting-started.md), [Equipment Management](equipment-management/getting-started.md), [Incident Management](incident-management/getting-started.md), and [Incident Reporting](incident-reporting/getting-started.md). If you are looking for a particular topic, use the ![](.gitbook/assets/3134345-200.png)**Search** function in the top right. For general information, check out our guides below.&#x20;

You have a duty to respond to emergencies; we have a duty to _innovate_ - to keep improving our software using the latest technologies available. We are regularly updating our software to meet the complex and ever-evolving needs of emergency response groups, so check back regularly for information on how to use these new features as they are added.
