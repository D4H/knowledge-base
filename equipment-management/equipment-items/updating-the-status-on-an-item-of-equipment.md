# Updating the status on an item of equipment

To mark an item of equipment as out of service and not operational:

* Navigate to the item of equipment
* Click **Change Status**
* You can leave a comment if you need to add information as to why you are marking the item as out of service
* You can also mark the item as a 'Critical Item' so that the system generates an alert whenever this item is marked as out of service
