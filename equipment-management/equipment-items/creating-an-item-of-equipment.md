# Creating an Item of Equipment

To create an item of equipment:

* Navigate to **Logistics** -> **Equipment**
* Open up Categories and click through to the category and kind where you want to add an item of equipment
* Click **Add Item**
* The system will automatically generate a unique reference number for you

{% hint style="info" %}
You can give your item a different reference if you are already using references. For example, you could put in 'ANCHOR-1', 'ANCHOR-2', 'BOX-2' or 'TRUCK-23' etc. **Remember** the reference must be unique in the system.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

* By clicking **Create Item**, a new page will open up where you can enter further details relating to the item such as Manufacturer, Model, [Expired Date](setting-expiration-requirements-and-pre-expiry-notifications.md), etc
* By clicking **Quick Add** your item will be created with no additional details, however, you can add these in later by updating the item

You can attach an image to the item's profile. However, if you have several items of the same [manufacturer and model](../manufacturers-and-models/), it is advised to attach the image of the item to the model. This will set the photo as the profile photo for all items of that model.\
