# Assigning A Barcode To An Item

{% hint style="info" %}
Barcodes must be unique numbers and are unable match Ref #s on any piece of equipment. &#x20;

**For example;** if a Ref # is 1234 on a Portable Radio and the barcode you are trying to add to Emergency Kit is 001234 you will receive a _Not Unique_ error message __ when trying to add the barcode number.&#x20;

You can check this by typing in 1234 the Search bar at the top right of the account.
