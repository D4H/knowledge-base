# Equipment Management App

Use the [D4H Equipment Management](../getting-started.md) app to track, repair, and inspect your equipment. Barcoding your items allows you to look them up instantly with an in-app scanner. All D4H apps allow for the use of [biometric authentication](../../shared-services/biometric-authentication.md) to secure your data.\
\
Switch between areas of the app by clicking the white ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/more options.png>) in the upper left hand corner of the main screen. The main sections of the Equipment Management app are:\


## Home

The home screen is the first thing you see when opening the app. It shows recently viewed items, upcoming inspections, and an overview of repairs. In the bottom right corner of the home screen there is a barcode symbol. Click that to open the scanner and scan your [equipment barcodes](../equipment-barcoding/). \


## Inspections

View your upcoming [inspections](../inspections/) in the Inspections section. They are automatically sorted by inspection due date. Click the symbol in the upper right corner to show the option to [sort by location](displaying-equipment-data-by-location-in-the-app.md). See instructions below for more information about displaying equipment data by location. 

## Repairs
