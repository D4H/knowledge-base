# Creating an Inspection

To create an inspection go to the Inspections tab:

* Click **Add Inspection**
* Give your inspection a title such as 'Annual Rope Inspection'
* You can add your inspection to a bundle to group inspections together. E.g. 'Rescue'
* Click **Add Inspection** and your new inspection will appear at the bottom of the list
* You will see the inspection is paused![Image Placeholder](<../../.gitbook/assets/pause icon.png>)
* Click into the inspection and click **Update Details** to add further details and update the due date (see below for more information about these fields)
* Click **Save Changes **at the bottom of the screen

{% hint style="info" %}
The first time you look at the inspection you'll see that all the items are due immediately. As the system will not know when the items were last inspected you may need to update this. 
{% endhint %}

* To set the correct due dates click on the green tick ![Image Placeholder](<../../.gitbook/assets/green tick.png>) next to each item
* Select the due date from the calendar picker
* Click **Save Changes**
* You will need to do this for all items so that the inspection due dates are correct going forward
