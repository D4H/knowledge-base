The above instructions can also be used to move equipment to a new [location](./). Instead of selecting **Issued to Member**, simply choose the location you want to move the item to.   
  
You will see below that if there are sub-locations available to move the item to, then additional drop down boxes will appear. This allows you to drill down to the exact location of the item.
