# Categories & Kinds

Categories and Kinds are how you will organize and define your equipment in Equipment Management.   
  
Categories will be a broad description of the items of equipment you have in your cache, such as Response Bags, Respiratory or Rigging.    
  
Kinds should be a singular broad statement describing your items of equipment. For example, in a Category 'Medical Equipment', you could have kinds such as 'Defibrillator', 'Medical Tape', Spinal Board', 'Trauma Shears' and so on. You will need to set a type for your kind, this will be either reusable, disposable or vehicle.
