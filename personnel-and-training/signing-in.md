# Signing-in

### WEB APP

To gain access to your D4H account for the first time you need to ask the D4H administrator in your team to send you an 'invitation' from the system. You will receive an email with an activation link that will allow you to create your username and password and then sign in.  
  
This is how you will sign in for any of the below modules:  
  


* [Personnel & Training ](getting-started.md)
* [Equipment Management](https://support.d4h.org/d4h-equipment-management/equipment-management) 
* [Incident Reporting](https://support.d4h.org/d4h-incident-reporting/incident-reporting)
