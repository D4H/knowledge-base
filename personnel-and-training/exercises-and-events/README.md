# Exercises and Events

### Exercises

Build a schedule of pre-planned training exercises and request [personnel](../../incident-management/personnel.md) to attend and collect their responses in real-time. Training exercises are directly comparable with D4H [Incident Reporting](../../incident-reporting/getting-started.md) entries so you can compare training versus your responses by [resources](../../shared-services/resources.md), [tags](../../shared-services/tags.md), attendance, and more.

### Events

Log activities such as meetings, maintenance, public events, and any other activities on your activities [calendar](../calendar.md). Request attendance and collect attendance responses in real-time and compile [reports](../../shared-services/reports.md) which can then be published for your records.
