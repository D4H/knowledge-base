# Exercises and Events

### Exercises

Build a schedule of pre-planned training exercises and request [personnel](../untitled/) to attend and collect their responses in real-time. Training exercises are directly comparable with D4H [Incident Reporting](../../incident-reporting/getting-started.md) entries so you can compare training versus your responses by [resources](../../shared-services/resources/), [tags](../../shared-services/tags/), attendance, and more.

### Events

Log activities such as meetings, maintenance, public events, and any other activities on your activities [calendar](../calendar/). Request attendance and collect attendance responses in real-time and compile [reports](../../shared-services/reports/) which can then be published for your records.\
