# Duplicating Activities

Within [Personnel & Training](broken-reference), and [Incident Reporting](broken-reference), it is possible to 'Duplicate' an activity (Exercise, Event, or Incident) to make an exact copy of it.

To duplicate an Activity:

* Go to the Activity you'd like to duplicate
* On the right side bar, click **Duplicate Activity**
* In the pop-up dialog, set the new Reference # and Dates&#x20;
* Optionally, use the Advanced Options to only duplicate select components

After duplication is complete, you'll be given an option to continue creating further duplicates to enable you to create a set of activities all in the same moment, without leaving the screen.
{% endhint %}
