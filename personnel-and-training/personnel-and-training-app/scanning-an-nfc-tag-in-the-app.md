# Scanning an NFC Tag in the App

Once you have assigned an NFC Tag to a Member you can use your [Personnel Mobile App](./) to scan the NFC Tag that is adhered to a Member's helmet or ID card to pull up their profile page.

* Click on the scan icon on the bottom of the screen of the mobile app
* Once the Ready to Scan screen pops up hold the NFC tag close to the phone to scan
* This will open the member's profile
* You can then click on [Qualifications](../qualifications/), [Groups,](../groups/) their Schedule ([On-Call Planner](../on-call-planner/) or [Activities](../../shared-services/activities/)) or View Member to view details of that member's profile (with the proper [User Permission](../../user-access/permissions/)).

If the icon on the bottom right in the [Personnel Mobile App](./) shows a QR code icon, or after clicking the icon the Ready to Scan doesn't appear you will first need to update the [Scanning Device Setting](personnel-app-settings.md#scanning-device).
