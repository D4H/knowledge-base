# Personnel & Training App

Use the [Personnel & Training app](./) to quickly look up information about your members, view your upcoming events on the calendar, and change your [on-call status](../on-call-planner/). Also use it to view and post announcements on the whiteboard. All D4H apps allow for the use of [biometric authentication](../../shared-services/biometric-authentication.md) to secure your data.

Switch between areas of the app by clicking the white![Image Placeholder](../../.gitbook/assets/more-options.png)in the upper left hand corner of the main screen. The main sections of the Personnel & Training app are:

### Home

The home screen is the first page you will be taken to upon entering the app. Go here to view upcoming activities, view announcements on the whiteboard, and change your on-call status. 

### Calendar
