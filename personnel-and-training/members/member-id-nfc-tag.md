# Member ID NFC Tag

Our [Personnel Mobile App](../personnel-and-training-app/) on iOS and Android allows you to associate an NFC Tag with each of your personnel.

These tags are plastic stickers with adhesive and may be affixed to your helmet (_if appropriate and safe to do so_) or ID Card.  This gives you the ability to tap the persons tag with your phone to see their [Member Profile](member-profile-fields.md), [Qualifications](../qualifications/), and [Group](../groups/) memberships.
