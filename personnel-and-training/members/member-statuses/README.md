# Member Statuses

**Operational** is the status for all of your trained members. These members are considered part of your response team.

**Non-Operational** is the status for members who assist behind the scenes such as Administrators.  This status can also be used for members whom are off-duty for an extended period of time or are Probationary.

**Retired** is the status for members of your team that have retired. If a member is moved to this status their access is also removed. See [Retirement Reasons](retirement-reasons.md).&#x20;

**Observer** is the status for members that can be given permission to sign into a team but will never appear in attendance lists, will never get email alerts and will never get a weekly briefing.  They will only have access to log in and view the same data as an individual with [Member Permission ](../../../user-access/permissions.md)without being included in the day-to-day administration of your team.

{% hint style="warning" %}
We do not advise deleting members, instead we advise you move them into Retired status. This way you will not lose any data linked to them.
