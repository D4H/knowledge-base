# Granting Access to Members

**Access Level Required: Owner, Editor.**\
\
Once you have [added members](../../user-access/inviting-new-users.md) to the account you will want to grant some of them access and assign them a [permission level](../../shared-services/access-and-permissions/).\
\
To grant members access to your account:

* Go to ![](../../.gitbook/assets/access.png) **Access**
* In the **Username** column click **Send Invite** for the member you want to grant access
* Each member must have a valid email address for the system to send the email invite to
* Select the permission level you wish to grant the member
* Click **Send invite**
* This member will now receive an email invite asking them to create their D4H account\


To change a members permission level:
