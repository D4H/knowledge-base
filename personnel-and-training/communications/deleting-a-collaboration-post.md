# Deleting a collaboration post

To delete a real time collaboration post you must be the creator of the post or be an administrator with Owner or Editor permissions. 

* Hover your mouse over the post
* A small delete icon will appear
* By clicking on this icon, the post will be deleted
* There is no bulk delete function, therefore you need to do this for every post you wish to delete
