# Sending a message

To send a message:

* Go to **Logistics** and **Communications**
* Select the relevant channels (Email, Voice\*, or Text Message\*) which are listed near the top of the Send Message page. (Voice and Text depend on your provider)

{% hint style="info" %}
Paid services such as text messages and voice require Editor level
{% endhint %}

* Choose the recipients to whom you would like to send the message

{% hint style="info" %}
Recipients can be chosen by group, a type of member (e.g. all operational members), individually or any combination of these. For example, the Hazmat team may be required at an exercise and a non-operational team member who has an administration function may be required to attend and document the exercise.
{% endhint %}

* Type your message in the box. If only the email channel is chosen, there will be the option to enter a Subject also.
* Click **Send Message**
* A notification will pop up indicating the amount of messages being sent and what channels they are being sent by

{% hint style="info" %}
If a member's name appears in red, this means the member does not have a valid email address and it must be updated before you can send an email to them.
{% endhint %}
