# Texting in a "Command Message"?

**Access Level Required: Owner, Editor, Member.**

{% hint style="info" %}
If you receive a text message from your team account and want to reply, simply reply as normal.
{% endhint %}

\*To text in a command, you must always include the letter D (or d, case doesn't matter!) at the start of the command.\
\
**The following commands apply only to those who have Member+ with SMS permissions, Editors and Owners.**\
\
If you need to check your response team’s status → D STATUS\
(total persons on-call and any active alerts)\
\
It is possible to just send text messages to only the operational members. For example, if you want to let your team know about an upcoming training session but don’t need to inform any of the non-operational members → D TO OP your message here\
\
As well as this, you can send messages just to the operational members who are on-call. This can be useful in situations such as if you have been tasked to an incident and need to get critical information to the team members who are responding → D TO ON your message here\
\
If you need to send a text message to all team members whether they are operational or non-operational → D TO ALL your message here\
\
If you want to send a text message to a particular group, you firstly need to ensure that the group has a Communications shortcode set for them (Groups -> Update Details). For example, you may have set the shortcode for your member group of Cardiac Responders as CPR. if you are sending a message to the members of your team who are part of the Cardiac Responders group → D TO CPR Is anyone available to go to Sector A now?

New vs Old. We have introduced a new [Communications](./) module, which allows your response team’s messaging to be managed with ease. If you used our old SMS module, it is important to note that you no longer need to use your pin with the new Communications module.
