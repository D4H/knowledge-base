# Setting the number of members required on-call

The threshold of members required to be on call at any time can be set from the On-Call Planner:

* Select On Call Planner from the Operations drop down menu
* Click **Defaults** on the right hand side
* Update the required member threshold in the **Required** drop down menu at the top of the page

  
You will see a notification on the Dashboard as your teamâ€™s number of off-call members nears and surpasses the set threshold.
