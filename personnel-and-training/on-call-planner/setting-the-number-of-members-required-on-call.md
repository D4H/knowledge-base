# Setting the number of members required on-call

The threshold of members required to be on call at any time can be set from the On-Call Planner:

* Select **Operations** > **On Call Planner**&#x20;
* Click **Defaults** on the right hand side
* Update the required member threshold in the **Required** drop down menu at the top of the page

You will see a notification on the Dashboard as your teamâ€™s number of off-call members nears and surpasses the set threshold.
