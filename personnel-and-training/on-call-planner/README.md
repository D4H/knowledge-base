# On-Call Planner

Your personnel can mark themselves on-call and off-call through our mobile app or through the web application. The on-call planner helps you to monitor available resources day-by-day and set required levels of [personnel](../members/) or [qualifications](../qualifications/) to ensure the right complement of skills are always available on-call and ready to respond.

\
The default setting in your account will be Off-Call. To change this to on-call:

* Go to Operations and On-Call Planner
* Select **Defaults**
* Change the **Default Status** to On-Call
* Click **Save Changes** at the bottom of the page\

It is not possible to report on On/Off-Call data.  A true measure of a Member's availability is their Attendance.&#x20;
