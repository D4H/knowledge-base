# Bulk import Members from a spreadsheet

{% hint style="info" %}
[Owner or Editor](../../user-access/permissions.md) permission level is required.
{% endhint %}

You have the ability to bulk-add members by uploading a spreadsheet. Spreadsheet files should be exported to CSV format from your spreadsheet software before upload.\
\
We recommend you use our Bulk-Upload Template. Make sure all your rows match our sample, including date format DD/MM/YYYY. To download the template and to then import the spreadsheet with member details:

* From the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/access.png" alt="" data-size="line"> **Access** menu click the **+ Add Members** button
* Click **Upload Spreadsheet**
* Download the Bulk-Upload Template
* Once populated, go back to this screen
* Upload your CSV file
* You can review the data before importing
* Once you are happy click **Import All Members**
* Now that your members have been added you will need to [grant them access](granting-access-to-members.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you plan on importing data into [custom fields](../../shared-services/custom-fields/), the custom fields must be created before doing the import. You also need to make sure that the name of the spreadsheet column you are importing data from is an exact match to the name of the custom field.&#x20;
