# Granting Access to Members

**Access Level Required: Owner, Editor.**  
  
Once you have [added members](https://support.d4h.org/d4h-incident-reporting/members) to the account you will want to grant some of them access and assign them a [permission level](https://support.d4h.org/d4h-equipment-management/access-permissions).  
  
To grant members access to your account:

* Go to ![](https://support.d4h.org/desk/file/10285715/image.png) **Access**
* In the **Username** column click **Send Invite** for the member you want to grant access
* Each member must have a valid email address for the system to send the email invite to
* Select the permission level you wish to grant the member
* Click **Send invite**
* This member will now receive [an email invite](https://support.d4h.org/d4h-incident-reporting/signing-in) asking them to create their D4H account
