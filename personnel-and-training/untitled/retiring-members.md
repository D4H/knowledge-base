# Retiring Members

{% hint style="info" %}
[Owner or Editor](../../user-access/permissions/) permission level is required.
{% endhint %}

Retiring members allows their data to remain in D4H without having them appear in lists with your active members. For this reason, retiring a member is almost always preferred over deleting. \
\
To retire a member:

* Open the member's profile
* Click **Update Details**
* Click the Status field on their profile and select Retired
* Select a retirement reason from the list of options
* Click Finished to save your changes

{% hint style="info" %}
Owners can configure retirement reasons under Settings by going to Modules > Members and then selecting to add or edit [Retirement Reasons](https://support.d4h.org/personnel-and-training/members/member-statuses/retirement-reasons).
{% endhint %}
