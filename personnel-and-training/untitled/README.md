# Members

Lookup personnel information within one central database with contact details, position, and current status. Profiles will display training levels, [qualifications](../qualifications/), experience, and [attendance](../../shared-services/activities/setting-attendance-periods-on-an-activity.md). Customize profiles with custom fields to add your own drop-downs and text fields.  
  
In order to invite a new team member to your account, you must first [add them as a member](../../user-access/inviting-new-users.md).
