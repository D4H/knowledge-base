# Selecting a year that isn't on the calendar picker

When you click to select the date on a calendar input, we show 10 years in the future, and 20 years in the past of the selected date.\
\
To pick a year outside these ranges:

* Pick the latest (or earliest) year
* Then click again and it'll recenter giving you more years to select from
