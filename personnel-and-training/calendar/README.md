# Calendar

Manage your entire training program with a shared team calendar. Compatible iCal feeds for Outlook and Google Calendar are available and it is accessible directly through our smartphone application.\
\
The purpose of the calendar is to display information about upcoming Events and Exercises and to indicate the [members](../members/)' attendance statuses at these activities. It also allows the member to click into any of the listed [activities](../../shared-services/activities/), where they can then update their attendance if necessary.
