# Calendar

Manage your entire training program with a shared team calendar. Compatible iCal feeds for Outlook and Google Calendar are available and it is accessible directly through our smartphone application.  
  
The purpose of the calendar is to display information about upcoming Events and Exercises and to indicate the members' attendance statuses at these activities. It also allows the member to click into any of the listed activities, where they can then update their attendance if necessary.
