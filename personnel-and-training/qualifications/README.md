# Qualifications

Make the administration of qualifications and training records easy. Customizable pro-active [email alerts](https://support.d4h.org/d4h-incident-reporting/email-notifications) will notify both the training officer and the individual that qualifications are soon to expire. [Set required and preferred expectations](https://support.d4h.org/qualifications2/setting-a-qualification-expectation-for-a-group) based on group membership to identify training needs.
