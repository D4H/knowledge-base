# Filter Control Room Incidents by Situation field

In [Incident Management](../getting-started.md), you can filter [Control Room](./) incidents based on [Situation](../situation/) fields. This is particularly useful if you share an account regionally as you can configure it so the Control Room only displays the incidents relevant to your team.   
To filter the Control Room:

* Click the **Filter** button in the upper right corner of the Control Room
* Click **Add Filter**
* Select the field you would like to filter by from the dropdown on the left
* Select the parameter you would like to filter by from the dropdown on the right
* Click **Apply**

You can add more filters by repeating the process above. Delete filters by clicking the garbage can icon to the right of the filter. You can also delete all the filters at once by clicking **Clear all**.
