# Setting a Default Play for Control Room

In [Incident Management](../getting-started.md), you have the option to set a default [play](../plays/) that the [Control Room](./) quick starts every time. This enables a one-click incident creation. If you have not yet created any plays, check out our article on [creating a new play](../plays/creating-a-new-play.md) to get started.   
  
To set a default play, go to the [Admin Area ](../admin-area/)and follow the steps below.

* Go to **Settings** &gt; **Preferences**
* Navigate to the **Incidents** section 
* Select one of the plays from the Default play dropdown menu
