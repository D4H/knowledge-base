# Control Room

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/control room.png>)

The Control Room shows all ongoing incidents in one location and facilitates multi-incident management. Examples of where it can be used include EOCs, security centers, and command posts. To access it, click **Control Room** on your [Channels](../channels/) page. 

The main sections of the Control Room are:

## Incidents

You can quickly move between different incidents within the Control Room. Double click on an incident to view it. Within each incident, you can update both the [Situation Report ](../situation/)and Incident Log without leaving the Control Room interface.

**Incident Log**

Within an Incident, click on the speech bubble icon in the top right corner to open the Incident Log panel.

**Enter Channel**

If an incident further evolves and requires more functionality, within an Incident you can press **Enter Channel **to enter the full channel as normal.

## Updates

View the Control Room log in the Updates section. Use this area to share announcements and general information with other incident managers. Click on the **All** tab to view a full audit trail of the Control Room.

## Library

Store important documents and links for future reference in the Library. You can create folders to organize these items. Any documents added in [Collections](../admin-area/collections/) will automatically be added to the Library here. 

## Archived

Past incidents appear here, but will be deleted out of the system after a certain period of time.\
Download the available archive for your records by clicking the box icon. If you have our [Incident Reporting](../../incident-reporting/getting-started.md) product, make sure the bar chart icon has a green tick next to it indicating it has been synced across.﻿You can reactivate any of these incidents by going to **More Options \[⋮]** and clicking **Re-activate**.
