## Disabling Two-Factor Authentication

Only an [Owner](../../user-access/permissions.md) can disable 2FA for a user.

* Click on the **green** ⇅ in the top right hand corner
* Go to the **Admin Area > Collections > Personnel**
* Open the Member Profile which you are disabling the Two-Factor Authentication for
* The only way to disable 2FA is to **Revoke access** for that member

* &#x20;You can then [resend an invite](https://support.d4h.com/incident-management/personnel/adding-personnel-in-collections) to the member and they will be able to login without using 2FA
* This is the most secure way to disable 2FA for a member
