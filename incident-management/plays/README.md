# Plays

#### WEB APP

Within[ Incident Management](../getting-started.md), Plays are the automations that run when a [channel](../channels/) is started.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/plays.png)

You can configure your play to automatically add modules such as [Task Boards](../task-boards/) and [Status Boards](../status-boards/) to your channel when you start it. You can also build out data in [collections ](../admin-area/collections/)and choose what you want available in a play by selecting those items.

You can create as many plays as you need. You will also have the option to start a blank play if what you are looking for does not exist when opening a new incident. Here's some examples you could create in your account

## Admin Area

Each play will be configured in the [Admin Area](../admin-area/) to specify which modules should be turned on and what data from the collections should be available.

## Collections

[Collections](../admin-area/collections/) are used to pre-load data into a Play. For example you might have a Play called 'Tropical Storm' and you could enter all the county storm shelters into the collections in advance. You can then add these collections and a [status board](../status-boards/) of 'Shelters' to your 'Tropical Storm' play and they will appear in the channel every time you start a 'Tropical Storm' play.
