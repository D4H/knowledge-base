## Name \(Required\)

The name will appear in the Start menu and will be the event / incident name. Choose a short name that ideally fits on a single line.

## Description

Give a brief description as to what the type of event / incident is. 

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, you could have a play called Severe Winter Storm, your description could be one of the following:

* Severe Weather Response
* Blizzard, Heavy Snows, Ice Storm
{% endhint %}

## Selecting An Icon \(Required\)

Select an icon for the play. This icon will be used to represent the play in the Start menu. Press Show more to see more icons, and use keywords to search for the name of an icon.

## Channel Status

These are the different [statuses](../status-boards/) or alert levels you can use to categorize an incident. They can be defined in Settings.  
  
This is also where you can set the default for alerting users that a channel has been created. Note, this can be overridden when starting a [channel](../channels/).
