# Importing Collections into a Channel

#### WEB APP

Within [Incident Management](../../getting-started.md), it is possible to create and store pre-loaded content in [collections](./). Once you have created your collections in the [Admin Area](../), they become available to use within a [channel](../../channels/).   
  
When you go to your open channel and go to a module you have pre-loaded with data, click on the small drop down arrow beside **Add**.

Your collection data will now be available to import into your channel.  


Here is an example within the [Roles](../../roles/) module.

Teams and their respective roles are pre-loaded into the Admin Area:

Back in your open channel you can now import the teams and roles
