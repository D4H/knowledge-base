# Form Builder & Field Types

#### WEB APP

The form builder is used to create all form [templates](../) for all modules in your [Incident Management](../../../getting-started.md) account. You can use the form builder to add new sections and new fields to your templates.&#x20;

## Adding Sections and Fields

* To add a new section to a form click **+ Add section**
* If you want to give that section a heading, type it into the black bar
* Alternatively, you can leave this blank and it will appear as a page break in your form

{% hint style="info" %}
You have the option draw, auto generate or upload a signature.&#x20;

**Automatic Signature Generator**

If you don't want to draw, we'll generate an automatic signature for you in a handwritten script.

**Uploading Your Signature**

If you have a photo of your signature, you can upload it as your default one. Single-click sign and lock forms from here.

**Locking A Form**

Signing a form will Lock it. This means that it is uneditable by you or other users. Whoever signed the form, approved it. Unlocking a form will erase all signatures on the form. Unlock a form from the context menu.
{% endhint %}

* **Org Chart:** This adds an organization chart field to your template. This pulls the Org chart from the [Roles](../../../roles/) module. You have to have the Org chart created here first or it won't appear when you add the field to your template.&#x20;
