# D4H Products Integration

#### WEB APP

Here you can connect our other products ([Personnel & Training](../../../../personnel-and-training/getting-started.md) and [Incident Reporting](../../../../incident-reporting/getting-started.md)) together to import and export data.

Go to the [Admin Area](../../)

* Open **Settings** > **D4H Products Integration**
* Turn on Integration Enabled by clicking the box
* The **D4H Server Location** will already be set for you
* Click ![Image Placeholder](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/crayon icon.png>)**Select team**
* Log in with the username and password that you use to log into your Personnel & Training / Incident Reporting account (this is not your Incident Management account login)
* Choose your team and click **Select**

{% hint style="info" %}
This enables you to do the following:

* import your Personnel data from your Personnel & Training account
* export an incident / exercise / event to your Incident Reporting module. When you [shut down a channel](../../../channels/shutting-down-a-channel.md) in Incident Management you will now have the option to create a draft activity report in your Incident Reporting account
