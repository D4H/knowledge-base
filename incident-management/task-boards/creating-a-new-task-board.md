## Selecting An Icon (Required)

## Name (Required)

The app name will appear in the navigation menu and throughout the software. Choose a short name that ideally fits on a single line.

{% hint style="info" %}
Names should be unique and clear. Ideally it would be a name that encompasses the task lists and tasks such as "Immediate Actions", "Security Tasks", "Search Assignments", and "Requests". 
{% endhint %}

## Unique Name (Required)

The unique name is auto-generated. The unique name is used later to create [relationships](../admin-area/templates/form-builder-and-field-types/) between modules and reference this module in custom expressions.

## Tasks Statuses

These are the different statuses within your tasks workflow. You can delete the existing statuses and add in your own custom statuses. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Examples

* Closed / Open
* Not Started / Not Applicable / In Progress / Complete
{% endhint %}

## Default Status

You can set a default status from the statuses above. You may want to set the default to 'Not Started' if you choose to keep this status.
