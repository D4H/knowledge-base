# Forms

![](../../.gitbook/assets/forms.png)

In your [Incident Management](../getting-started.md) account you can create forms. These could include ICS forms, meeting schedules, action plans, executive summaries etc.   


{% hint style="info" %}
Ideas for your Forms:

* ICS 205 Radio Comms
* Injury Report
* Hazardous Exposure Form
* Action Plan
* Public Information
* Cover Page
* Aircraft Data
* Damage Assessment Report
* Status Report
* EMT Meeting Agenda
{% endhint %}

## Templates

Each form has a [Template](../admin-area/templates/) which outlines its layout.

{% page-ref page="creating-a-new-form.md" %}

{% page-ref page="../admin-area/templates/form-builder-and-field-types/" %}

{% page-ref page="../admin-area/templates/form-builder-and-field-types/show-or-hide-a-form-section-based-on-the-value-of-a-field-option.md" %}

## Collections

[Collections](../admin-area/collections/) are used to pre-load data into a Form. For example you might have a Meeting Schedule and you could enter all the unchanging details into the collections in advance. They are then available pre-loaded to import during an Incident.  


{% page-ref page="../admin-area/collections/creating-collections.md" %}

{% page-ref page="../admin-area/collections/importing-collections-into-a-channel.md" %}

{% page-ref page="../plays/including-collections-in-a-play.md" %}

## Using Forms

When you come to use a Form during an event you should first add it to your channel, or start your channel with a [Play](https://support.d4h.org/incident-management-admin-area/plays) that includes it.
