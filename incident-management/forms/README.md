# Forms

![](../../.gitbook/assets/forms.png)

In your [Incident Management](../getting-started.md) account you can create forms. These could include ICS forms, meeting schedules, action plans, executive summaries etc. \


{% hint style="info" %}
Ideas for your Forms:

* ICS 205 Radio Comms
* Injury Report
* Hazardous Exposure Form
* Action Plan
* Public Information
* Cover Page
* Aircraft Data
* Damage Assessment Report
* Status Report
* EMT Meeting Agenda
{% endhint %}

## Templates

Each form has a [Template](../admin-area/templates/) which outlines its layout.

{% content-ref url="creating-a-new-form.md" %}
[creating-a-new-form.md](creating-a-new-form.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../admin-area/templates/form-builder-and-field-types/" %}
[form-builder-and-field-types](../admin-area/templates/form-builder-and-field-types/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../admin-area/templates/form-builder-and-field-types/show-or-hide-a-form-section-based-on-the-value-of-a-field-option.md" %}
[show-or-hide-a-form-section-based-on-the-value-of-a-field-option.md](../admin-area/templates/form-builder-and-field-types/show-or-hide-a-form-section-based-on-the-value-of-a-field-option.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Collections

[Collections](../admin-area/collections/) are used to pre-load data into a Form. For example you might have a Meeting Schedule and you could enter all the unchanging details into the collections in advance. They are then available pre-loaded to import during an Incident.\


{% content-ref url="../admin-area/collections/creating-collections.md" %}
[creating-collections.md](../admin-area/collections/creating-collections.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../admin-area/collections/importing-collections-into-a-channel.md" %}
[importing-collections-into-a-channel.md](../admin-area/collections/importing-collections-into-a-channel.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../plays/including-collections-in-a-play.md" %}
[including-collections-in-a-play.md](../plays/including-collections-in-a-play.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Using Forms

When you come to use a Form during an event you should first add it to your channel, or start your channel with a [Play](../plays/) that includes it.

{% content-ref url="../situation/taking-a-snapshot.md" %}
[taking-a-snapshot.md](../situation/taking-a-snapshot.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="duplicating-a-form.md" %}
[duplicating-a-form.md](duplicating-a-form.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="adding-a-form-to-a-channel.md" %}
[adding-a-form-to-a-channel.md](adding-a-form-to-a-channel.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../situation/printing-to-pdf.md" %}
[printing-to-pdf.md](../situation/printing-to-pdf.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../situation/sharing-by-public-link-share-by-public-link.md" %}
[sharing-by-public-link-share-by-public-link.md](../situation/sharing-by-public-link-share-by-public-link.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../situation/viewing-the-audit-trail.md" %}
