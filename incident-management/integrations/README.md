# Integrations

#### WEB APP

It is possible to connect 3rd party products to your [Incident Management](../getting-started.md) account.

## [Mass Notifications](../mass-notifications/)

You can [connect a mass notifications provider](../mass-notifications/adding-mass-notification-providers.md) which will allow you to broadcast messages from your [Channel](../channels/) to the address book groups in the provider. We never see your contacts in your provider, just the address book group names.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example 1:** You could have a mass notification provider with all citizens in your county or state broken into sending groups such as where they live or their vulnerability level. You can select those groups and push messages to them. 

**Example 2:** You could have a mass notification provider with all your staff grouped by building or facility. Push messages to them such as evacuation orders.
