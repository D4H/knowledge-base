# Importing Sample Templates

Once you have identified a [status board](/incident-management-status-boards/status-boards) or [form](/d4h-incident-management/forms) from our raw template collection that matches your team’s requirements, the following guide will walk you through adding it to your account. Depending on whether it is a form or a status board, the process will be slightly different. For both processes, start by going to the [Admin Area](/d4h-incident-management/admin-area). To access the Admin Area, click the green⇅in the upper right corner of your [Incident Management](/d4h-incident-management/incident-management) account. 

{% hint style="info" %}
If you do not see the arrows, you do not have the permission level necessary to access the Admin Area. Only Account Owners can access the Admin Area.
{% endhint %}

## Adding a Form 

To import a form into your account:

* Go to the **Admin Area** &gt; **Templates**
* Select Forms and click on **New form template**

## Customization

After importing a status board or form, they are ready to be used in any of your channels. However, you may want to have it customized for your team first. Since it is a template, you are able to edit any of the forms and status board configurations as you see fit. Remember, these templates are meant to help inspire you. You can change them, or not change them, as much as you want. Since you have a copy of the raw template, you can return it to the original template at any time by copying and pasting the old code over the new. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Ideas for possible edits

* changing names and terminology
* adjusting colors and symbols
* linking fields using [relationships](../admin-area/templates/form-builder-and-field-types/)
* adding additional fields you want to track
