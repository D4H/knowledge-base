# Linking a Role to a Task

#### WEB APP

[Roles](./) are often linked to an Assignee field on the [Tasks](../task-boards/) form. This means that when someone who has been assigned a role goes to the Tasks module, they are able to filter the tasks list to My Items. This will display only tasks assigned to their role.

{% hint style="info" %}
If something is assigned to you or your role, you will get a notification. If you are currently logged into your Incident Management account, the notification will pop up on screen. If you are not logged in, you will receive an email notification. 
{% endhint %}

To link a role to a task you need to add a [relationship field](../admin-area/templates/form-builder-and-field-types/) to both your Tasks form and to your Personnel Roles form in templates.
