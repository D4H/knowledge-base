# Tagging a Role in the Log

You can tag Roles against a log post. This makes it easy to see exactly what each post relates to. It also means you can log a post against a role and the individual in that role will receive a notification. To do this, go to Updates

* Click on the **+Tag **icon and start typing in the name of the role you wish to tag
* Select the role from the drop down
* Type your message and hit the **Enter **key or press the![](<../../.gitbook/assets/paper airplane icon.png>) icon
* Your post will now show in the log with the role tagged against it

Alternatively

* Go to ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/roles (1).png>) Roles
* Double click into the role you want to log a post against
* Click on the **log**![](<../../.gitbook/assets/speech box icon.png>) to open the Roles log
* The role is automatically tagged
* Type your message and hit the **Enter** key or press the![](<../../.gitbook/assets/paper airplane icon.png>) icon
* Your post will now show in the log with the role tagged against it
