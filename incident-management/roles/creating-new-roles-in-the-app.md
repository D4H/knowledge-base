# Creating Teams and Roles

**WEB APP**

Teams and roles can be created in individual channels or in the [Collections](../admin-area/collections/) section of the [Admin Area](../admin-area/). Creating them in Collections allows them to be used across multiple channels and to be included in [Plays](../plays/). Whether you are creating your teams and roles in a channel or in Collections, follow the steps below:

* Go to the **Roles** tab \(called **Personnel Roles** in Collections\)
* Click **Add Team**
* Give the team a name and click **Add**
* Select **Add Role** to the right of the team name 
* Enter the name of the role
* Click on the red check symbol
