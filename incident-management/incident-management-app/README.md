# Incident Management App

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/incident management mobile app.png>)

Use the Incident Management mobile app to manage your resources.  Remotely assign roles, view and update the situation, fill out forms, and complete tasks. Any changes made in the app will appear live on all other platforms as long as you are connected to the internet. All D4H apps allow for the use of [biometric authentication](../../shared-services/biometric-authentication.md) to secure your data.

After logging into the app, a page will appear displaying all of the ongoing incidents. Click into one to view the following sections:

## Situation

The [Situation ](../situation/)provides the latest updates on an event / incident. Depending on your [permission profile](../../user-access/permissions/), you can click on the fields to make changes to the situation report.&#x20;

## Roles

Assign [personnel ](../personnel/)to existing [roles](../roles/) in the app by clicking on a role then filling out the Assigned Personnel field. Clicking into a role will also allow you to fill out custom fields that have been added in advance to capture additional information about roles. See below for instructions on how to create a new role within the app.&#x20;

## Forms

Complete existing[ forms](../forms/) in the app by clicking on the forms and then selecting fields to add to. Add new forms by clicking the **+** in the bottom right and selecting a form type from the list of [templates](../admin-area/templates/).

## Logs

View and post [log communications](./#logs) in this section. Attach images and videos to messages to share with other team members.&#x20;

## Task Boards

[Complete task lists ](completing-a-task-list-in-the-app.md)and create new ones. Mark assignments as not started, in progress, or complete. Add notes to the [forms](../forms/) behind the individual tasks.&#x20;

## Status Boards

Add new rows to your [status boards](../status-boards/) while in the field. Record information to be shared with the rest of your team.&#x20;

## Personnel

View which [personnel](../personnel/) are in the channel and add new ones. Edit contact information and other custom fields. Delete personnel who are no longer needed.&#x20;

## **Library**

Store [files](../library/adding-a-new-file.md) and [links](../library/adding-a-new-link.md) to websites. Review resources that you normally use during an event / incident.
