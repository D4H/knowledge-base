# Loading Map Layers in Collections

#### WEB APP

[Collections](../collections/) allow you to create and store pre-loaded content for use during an event or incident. This includes map layers. Before you can use customized may layers in a [Channel](../channels/), first you need to add them in the Admin Area. 

Within your [Incident Management ](../getting-started.md)account go to the [Admin Area](../admin-area.md) and follow the steps below.

* Go to **Collections**
* Click on [Map](./) layers
* Click **+New Layer**
* Give the map layer a name, this will be the name that appears in the import dropdown in a channel
* Click on the gear cog ![](https://support.d4h.org/desk/file/10179628/2020-05-25%20at%2012.48.png) icon and select ![](https://support.d4h.org/desk/file/10206993/image.png) **Import layer**

{% hint style="info" %}
Supported formats for your map layers are: GeoJson \(.json + .geojson\), GPS Exchange format \(.gpx\), Keyhole Markup Language \(.kml, .kmz\), Shapefile archive \(.zip\)
{% endhint %}

* Upload your map layer and click **Import**
* This is now available to [import to an open channel](importing-map-layers-into-a-channel.md)
