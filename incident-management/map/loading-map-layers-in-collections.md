# Loading Map Layers in Collections

#### WEB APP

[Collections](../admin-area/collections/) allow you to create and store pre-loaded content for use during an event or incident. This includes map layers. Before you can use customized may layers in a [Channel](../channels/), first you need to add them in the Admin Area.&#x20;

Within your [Incident Management ](../getting-started.md)account go to the [Admin Area](../admin-area/) and follow the steps below.

* Go to **Collections**
* Click on [Map](./) layers
* Click **+New Layer**
* Give the map layer a name, this will be the name that appears in the import dropdown in a channel
* Click on the gear cog <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/gear icon.png" alt="" data-size="original"> icon and select <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/import icon.png" alt="" data-size="line"> **Import layer**

{% hint style="info" %}
Supported formats for your map layers are: GeoJson (.json + .geojson), GPS Exchange format (.gpx), Keyhole Markup Language (.kml, .kmz), Shapefile archive (.zip)
{% endhint %}

* Upload your map layer and click **Import**
* This is now available to [import to an open channel](importing-map-layers-into-a-channel.md)
