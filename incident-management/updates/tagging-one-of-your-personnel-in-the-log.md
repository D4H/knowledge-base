# Tagging one of your Personnel in the Log

* Click on the **+Tag** icon and start typing in the name of the person you wish to tag
* Select the member from the drop down
* Type your message and hit the **Enter** key or press the![](<../../.gitbook/assets/paper airplane icon.png>) icon
* Your post will now show in the log with the member tagged against it

Alternatively

* Go to **Personnel**
* Double click into the member you want to log a post against
* Click on the log![](<../../.gitbook/assets/speech box icon.png>) to open the Personnel log
* The member is now automatically tagged
* Type your message and hit the **Enter** key or press the![](<../../.gitbook/assets/paper airplane icon.png>) icon
