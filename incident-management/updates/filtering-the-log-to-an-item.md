# Filtering the Log to an Item

#### WEB APP

In Logs, you are able to filter the log posts to display only posts relating to a particular status board or an item from that status board. To do this go to Logs in your [Incident Management](../getting-started.md) account:

* Click the **filter** icon
* Select your status board from the drop down menu and click **Apply**\


![](<../../.gitbook/assets/filtering the log to an item.png>)

* All log posts now displayed will relate to the status board you have selected
* Alternatively, to filter it to a specific item from your status board, type the name of the item into the box
* Select the item from the drop down menu and click **Apply**\

* Now all posts displayed will be related to that item\


You can also filter the log from the status board directly. To do this go to your status board

* Click on the **log**<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/speech box icon.png" alt="" data-size="line"> to open the Status Board log
* You will see all log posts against this status board\

* The log will display only posts related to that item

* Alternatively, if you click directly on the tagged item in the log, it will take you to it and the filtered log
