# Creating an Announcement

#### WEB APP

You can 'upgrade' a log post to an announcement that will be displayed prominently at the top of the window. This will also generate an email notification, a mobile push and a web notification to every user invited to the incident. You can do this in both channels and the [Control Room](../control-room/).\
\
To create an announcement, first post an update in the log then roll-over the post and select the bull-horn icon.\
\
The announcement will be displayed at the top of the channel until cleared.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The header bar shows the most recent announcement only and clearing it only clear it for you.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
