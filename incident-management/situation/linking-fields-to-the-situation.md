# Linking fields to the Situation

#### WEB APP

Linked Fields allow data to be auto-filled from specific fields in the [Situation](./) form. You can link a field from any template to auto fill from a field on the Situation.

* Go to the [Admin Area ](../admin-area/)and [Templates](../admin-area/templates/)
* Open the template where you wish to link a field to the Situation
* Hover your mouse over the field you wish to link and then click the \[â‹®] that will appear on the right hand side of the field
* Click on the ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/chainlink icon.png>) chain link icon
* It will now say ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/chainlink icon.png>) This field is linked to the 'Start date' field of the Situation form ('Start date' is the example here)
