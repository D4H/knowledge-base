# Personnel

![](../../.gitbook/assets/personnel.png)

The Personnel module in your [Incident Management](../getting-started.md) account is where you will see a list of all your personnel who have access to that channel. You can see who is currently online from this screen. Anyone who is online will have a ![Image Placeholder](https://support.d4h.org/desk/file/10206722/image.png) green dot next to their name and anyone who is offline will have a ![Image Placeholder](https://support.d4h.org/desk/file/10206725/image.png) grey dot.

  
You can also assign a role to a member during an event / incident from this screen. 

## Templates

Personnel have a [Template](../admin-area/templates/) which outlines the layout of the form behind it, and which columns should display on the [list view](../admin-area/templates/list-layout-columns.md). There is only one Personnel template for all of your channels across your Incident Management account.

## Collections

[Collections](../admin-area/collections/) are used to pre-load data into the Personnel module. This is where you will add your personnel to create their D4H Incident Management account and assign them a permission profile.

## Using Personnel

When you open a new [channel](../channels/) you can add in teams and roles on the fly or you can import them from collections.  Or you could start your channel with a [Play](../plays/) that includes the teams and roles required for that type of incident / event.
