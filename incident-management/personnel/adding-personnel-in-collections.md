# Adding Personnel in Collections

#### WEB APP

To create a D4H [Incident Management](../getting-started.md) account for your [personnel](./) you will need to add them into [Collections](../admin-area/collections/) in the [Admin Area](../admin-area/). This is also where you will assign your personnel a permission profile.\
\
Once you have added your personnel into collections, they will receive an email invitation to the account. They will need to click **Create My Account** and follow the steps to access it. \
\
Go to Collections in the Admin Area

* Open Personnel
* Click on the orange **Add** button
* You will need at least a name and an email address to create an account
* Click the orange button **Create a D4H Incident Management Account**
* Under **Permission Profiles** select a profile from the drop down list\
