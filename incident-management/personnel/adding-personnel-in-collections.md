# Adding Personnel in Collections

#### WEB APP

To create a D4H [Incident Management](../getting-started.md) account for your [personnel](./) you will need to add them into [Collections](../admin-area/collections/) in the [Admin Area](../admin-area/). This is also where you will assign your personnel a permission profile.\
