# Sorting Personnel

### Sort by Online Status

You have the ability to always show online [Personnel](https://support.d4h.com/incident-management/personnel) at the top of the list.  When this is enabled (it's enabled by default), the Personnel will first sort by their online status (online first) then by the chosen sort order.

To disable this sort by filter:

* Within an incident click on **Personnel** on the left hand menu
* Click on the three dots menu ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Three Dots.png>) at the top right
* Click on **Sort By**
* Select the **Don't sort by online status** button
