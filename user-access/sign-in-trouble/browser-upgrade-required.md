# Browser Upgrade Required

Periodically we update the list of deprecated browsers. This does not mean we've blocked any specific browser, just older versions.&#x20;

Generally speaking, any up-to-date browser should be supported. Those that are unsupported are those that have not been updated in several years.\
\
To see if your access issues are due to this (or if it's the check on the D4H side that's too strict) you can send them to [https://www.whatismybrowser.com/](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/) and ask them to copy-paste the link that it provides under the heading "SHARE YOUR SYSTEM INFO WITH TECH SUPPORT". This will provide the information needed to validate.

If you browser needs to be updated, reach out to your organization's IT department to have this completed and if it's not needing to be updated reach out to our Support Desk by emailing [support@d4h.com](mailto:support@d4h.com).
