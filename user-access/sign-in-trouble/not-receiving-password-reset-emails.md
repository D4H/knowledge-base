# Not Receiving Password Reset Emails

Password reset emails are sent from a generic noreply@d4h email address, so ensure you are checking your Spam Folder in your email address account first before proceeding.

### Account Email VS Team Email

We store and manage your email address in two locations within the software for two different purposes. When you initially created your account, an email address was used to create both your Account Email and Team Email. Below is a description as to the differences and how to correct any issues.

#### **Account Email**

Your account email is directly linked to your username and is used when resetting your password. We also use this email address to send you newsletters and product update information.

To change your account email**:**&#x20;

* Select the **D4H logo** in the top left of the screen once logged in
* Scroll to the bottom of the page and under **Your Account** select **Update Email Address**

#### **Team Email**

Your team email is used for all communications within D4H specific to your team, like qualification alerts, the weekly digest emails and messages sent using the Communications Module.&#x20;

To change your team email:&#x20;

* Select the **Settings** icon in the top right,&#x20;
* Select **Update Profile**, and then update the **Email** field&#x20;

For most users, the Account Email and Team Email will/should be the same. Some users who have access to multiple teams may want different emails used in each team but should remember the email address associated with their D4H Account & Username.

Check your Spam Folder in your email if your account emails are correct.&#x20;
