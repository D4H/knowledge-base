If you are receiving an error message when trying to reset your password this could be because the reset link you received in an email is no longer valid.  A password reset link is only valid for **24 hours** after it is activated. If you have not actioned your password reset within 24 hours and the link is invalid, you will need to request a new link by following the steps outlined above.
