* Select **Collections** 
* Click on **Personnel** 
* Click on the name of the user that is blocked
* Select **unblock user**

To increase or decrease the number of attempts a user can make:

* Click on **Settings**
* Type a number into the field labeled **'Allowed login attempts after which the user account is locked**'.
