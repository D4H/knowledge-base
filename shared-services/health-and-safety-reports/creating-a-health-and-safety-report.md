# Creating a Health & Safety Report

## Creating a Health & Safety report:

* Go to Intelligence -> Health & Safety
* Click **+Add Report**
* To link the report to an event / exercise / incident switch **On Activity** to Yes and search for the activity
  * If you are linking the report to an event / exercise / incident, the pin on the map is set to the location on the activity, as are the start time and date
* If you are not linking the report to an activity click **Select On Map** to add the location information. Click into the magnifying glass on the map to search for a specific address
* Fill in the date and time information
* Select from the [Category and Severity](configuring-the-categories-and-severities.md) dropdowns
* Add any relevant information to the _What Happened_ and _Cause_ sections
* Add any measures that should be taken to mitigate this in the _Measures_ text field
* Click **Save Changes**

## Adding Corrective Action Tasks

* Once you have saved the report you can add your [tasks](../tasks/) in the _Corrective Actions_ section, these are your set of tasks to mitigate this&#x20;
* Click **+Add Task** and fill in the the details
* Click **Save Changes**
* You will now see 0 out of 2 (depending on how may tasks you added) under the _Corrective Actions_ header
* See [completing corrective actions](completing-corrective-actions.md) to complete the tasks
