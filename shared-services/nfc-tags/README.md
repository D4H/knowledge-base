# NFC Tags

Our [Personnel Mobile App](../../personnel-and-training/personnel-and-training-app/) on iOS and Android allows you to associate an NFC Tag with each of your personnel.

These tags are plastic stickers with adhesive and may be affixed to your helmet (_if appropriate and safe to do so_) or ID Card.  This gives you the ability to tap the persons tag with your phone to see their [Member Profile](../../personnel-and-training/members/member-profile-fields.md), [Qualifications](../../personnel-and-training/qualifications/), and [Group](../../personnel-and-training/groups/) memberships.
