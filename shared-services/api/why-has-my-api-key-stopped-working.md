# Why has my API key stopped working?

An API key will stop working in the following situations:

1. It was manually revoked by the key's owner;
2. The API access was turned off by a team administrator;
3. The password of the account it was linked to was changed;

For security reasons, changing your password will require you to re-authenticate on other sessions. This includes mobiles apps such as the D4H Equipment Management app, the Personnel & Training app and third parties, as well as other connected services like [ConnectRocket](../../personnel-and-training/personnel-and-training-integrations/connect-rocket.md).  
  
If you need to \(re\) create an API key, see [How do I obtain an API access key?](obtaining-an-api-access-key.md)
