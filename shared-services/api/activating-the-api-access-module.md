# Activating the API Access module

API access keys allow your team to share info from D4H with external applications or web services. This means members may generate API access tokens from their profile page to allow access over the API on their behalf.\
\
To activate the API Access module for your account:

* Go to the<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/User Icon" alt="" data-size="line">icon in the top right hand corner
* Click on **Team Settings**
* Under **Integrations** select **API Access**&#x20;
* Select **ON**&#x20;
* Click **Save Changes**

{% hint style="info" %}
Users will only have the same level of access through the API as they would through the D4H Web Application
{% endhint %}
