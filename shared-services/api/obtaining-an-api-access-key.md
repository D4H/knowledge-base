# Obtaining an API access key

API access keys are used for connecting with third party software that integrates with D4H and a multitude of other tools and tasks.\
\
Remember that API access keys are the equivalent of your username and password. Sharing your personal API access key gives full API access to your account.\
\
To create a personal API access key:

* Go to **Settings** in the top right of your screen
* Under **Integrations** select** API Access**
* From here you can label and generate API access keys. You will also be able to view existing access keys and revoke access if required

If you receive a message indicating that the API access module is not activated, contact an Account Owner on your team to have them activate the API module.\
