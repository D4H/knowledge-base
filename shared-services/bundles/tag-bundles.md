To create a new tag bundle, click the 'Create Bundle' button on the right hand side of the Tags page. There will be an option to chose a bundle when you create a tag, but you can also go back and update a tag's bundle whenever you need. If you do not select a bundle for a tag, it will appear in a section titled 'Unbundled'.
