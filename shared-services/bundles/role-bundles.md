# Role Bundles

Bundles will help organize your [roles](../../personnel-and-training/roles/), you can use them to group your roles together.   


| **Bundle**  |  **Locations in that bundle**  |
| :--- | :--- |
|  Officers  |  Duty Officer  |
|  |  Safety Officer  |
|  Training  |  Instructor  |
|  |  Trainee  |
|  Truck 1  |  Driver  |
|  |  Team Leader  |
|  |  Paramedic  |

To create a new role bundle, simply put your cursor in the 'Bundle' drop down field when you create the new role and type the name you want the bundle to have. It will add it as a new bundle once you click save changes at the bottom of the screen. If you leave the bundle field blank, your new role will appear at the top of the role list without any bundle information.
