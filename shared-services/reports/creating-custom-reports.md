# Creating Custom Reports

To create a custom report, go to **Intelligence** and select **Reports:**

* Click **Create New Report**
* Select the type of report you wish to create from the drop down menu
* Fill in the applicable information then select **Run Report**

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have created custom fields in your account, these will appear in the custom report area where you can select what you want returned in the report.
{% endhint %}

* Once a report has been run you can choose to export the information by selecting **Download as Spreadsheet**
* To save the custom report for future use click **Save Custom Report **at the bottom of the screen

When saving a custom report, you must give it a title. If saving a report with date ranges, use the relative dates e.g. 'Within Last 30 Days' rather than absolute dates 'Jan 5th - Feb 4th'. This will save you having to update the dates every time you re-run the report. \
\
Now that you have saved the report, you will be able to access the PDF by re-running the report.
