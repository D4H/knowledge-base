# Reports

The Reports section in D4H allows you to create custom reports using dropdowns and keywords to filter your data. There are built in monthly and annual reports, phone-lists, and attendance sheets. Both PDF and Spreadsheet exports are available for each report.

### Monthly Reports

These are built in reports that give you a breakdown of all your data for that specific month. Once you run the report, you will get a PDF which you can download or print. 

### Annual Reports

These are built in reports that give you a breakdown of all your data for that year. There is a mix of annual and quarterly reports. Once you run the report, you will get a PDF which you can download or print. 

### Custom Reports

You are able to create your own reports with custom queries. They can be saved so that they can easily be re-run in the future.
