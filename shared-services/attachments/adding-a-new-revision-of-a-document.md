# Adding a New Revision of an Attachment

If you have a new revision for an attachment, rather than delete it and upload it again:

* Go to the module where the attachment is located and click on the attachment title
* Click **Add Revision**
* This will allow you to upload the new version, and replace the old one
* You can leave a comment to note the changes made
* Click **Upload File**\
