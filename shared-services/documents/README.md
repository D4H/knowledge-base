# Documents

Upload training materials, manuals, and resources to a shared document repository. Attach photos to training exercises, [member's profiles](../../personnel-and-training/members/), items of equipment and ensure security by adding permissions to folders. This enables you to access important documents from any location and device.

Options are available to set the privacy of documents uploaded to your account.

A private document may only be accessed by Member+ and above. This allows you to restrict documents to certain members.

{% hint style="info" %}
Documents and photos can only be uploaded and edited by Owners, Editors and Member+. This includes member's profile photos.

The maximum file size of uploaded documents is 50mb.
