# Adding a New Revision of a Document

If you have a new revision for a document, rather than delete it and upload it again:

* Go to the document and click **Add Revision**
* This will allow you to upload the new version, and replace the old one
* You can leave a comment to note the changes made
* Click **Upload File**
