* **Note** only approved reports will be included in the statistics on the charts
* To view more reports click on any of the additional reports listed on the right hand side of the screen

The charts are a visual report that is displayed within the software. If you are looking to utilize them outside the software, we suggest taking a screenshot and importing it into your document/presentation as an image. 

On Mac, this can be done by selecting:  Command + Shift + 4 keys

On Windows this can be done by selecting: Windows + Shift + S keys
{% endhint %}
