# Sign-In Trouble

#### FORGOT YOUR PASSWORD?

A forgotten password can be reset on the D4H sign-in screen. Click on 'Forgotten your password?'. A reset link will be sent to you by email. This will also remind you of your username. If the email does not arrive, check your spam folder.

#### UNABLE TO SIGN-IN AFTER RESETTING YOUR PASSWORD?

Password Managers & Browser Auto-Fill Settings\
\
If you've recently updated your password it's important to update this information anywhere your login information is stored. 3rd party apps and programs that store your information or your internet browser's auto-fill settings can cause issues after a password reset as they can inadvertently input an old or incorrect password which causes your login to fail.\
\
To troubleshoot this, try logging in using an Incognito or Private internet browsing session. This will disable any password managers or auto-fill settings and require you to manually enter your username and password. If you're able to log in, update your password manager and auto-fill settings and try logging in again.&#x20;



#### NOT RECEIVING PASSWORD RESET EMAILS?

Account Email VS Team Email\
\
We store and manage your email address in two locations within the software for two different purposes. When you initially created your account, an email address was used to create both your Account Email and Team Email. Below is a description as to the differences and how to correct any issues.\
\
**Account Email:** Your account email is directly linked to your username and is used when resetting your password. We also use this email address to send you newsletters and product update information.\
To change your account email, select the D4H logo in the top left of the screen once logged in, scroll to the bottom of the page and under "Your Account" select "Update Email Address".\
\
**Team Email:** Your team email is used for all communications within D4H specific to your team, like qualification alerts, the weekly digest emails and messages sent using the Communications Module. \
To change your team email, select the Settings icon in the top right, select "Update Profile", then update the Email field. \
\
For most users, the Account Email and Team Email will/should be the same. Some users who have access to multiple teams may want different emails used in each team but should remember the email address associated with their D4H Account & Username.



#### IS YOUR PASSWORD RESET LINK EXPIRED?

Receiving an error message when trying to reset your password? This could be the cause.\
\
A password reset link is only valid for 24 hours after it is activated. If you have not actioned your password reset within 24 hours and the link is invalid, you will need to request a new link by following the steps outlined above.



#### ARE YOU SIGNING IN ON THE CORRECT SERVER?

We have servers around the world and you may be trying to log in to an incorrect URL.\
\
Every team has its own web address to sign in with. You should find yours and bookmark it. If you are unable to remember your team URL there is a generic login page that can assist you with accessing your account. \
Remember, even though you are physically located in one of these regions, your team account may not be on the local server.&#x20;
