# Access & Permissions

Once you have added members into your account, you have the option to [grant members a permission level](../../user-access/permissions.md). This will [send them an email invite ](../../user-access/inviting-new-users.md)to access the account.\
There are 4 access permissions: Member, Member+, Editor, and Owner. Within these access levels you can add specific permissions such as the ability to draft reports or other basic functions.
