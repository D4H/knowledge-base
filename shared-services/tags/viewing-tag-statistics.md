# Viewing tag statistics

To view tag statistics

* Go to **Intelligence** -&gt; **Tags**
* Tags are listed alphabetically, and by group if applicable, on this screen
* You will see the percentage statistics on each activity, and if you click on the tag itself you will see further detail
* You can access more advanced statistics by creating [Custom Reports](../reports/)

{% hint style="info" %}
Statistics are only generated once an activity has been approved. Draft activities will not generate statistics.
{% endhint %}
