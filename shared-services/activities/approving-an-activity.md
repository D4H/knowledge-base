# Approving an Activity

Statistics from activities are not added to [reports](../reports/) until the activity has been approved.

{% hint style="info" %}
Draft activity reports are displayed with an asterisk, there is no asterisk on an approved report. All daft reports will remain under the draft section where they can be continually edited and added to until approved.
{% endhint %}

To approve an activity:

* Go to the activity you want to approve and click **Approve Report **on the right hand side of the screen
* A confirmation box will appear on the screen with a reminder that no further edits will be possible unless reverted back to a draft

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are unable to approve an activity it may be for one of the following reasons

* You do not have the correct [permissions](../../user-access/permissions.md), only someone with Editor permissions and above can approve a report
* There are members with an 'Unconfirmed' attendance status, you will need to update their status to 'Attended' or 'Absent'
* The end date/time of the activity is in the future
{% endhint %}
