## Basic

On the basic tab of an activity you will be entering the main data relating to the activity, such as location, time of activity and a description. \
Your activities will be assigned a unique reference number, enabling you to easily locate and manage them.

* Add [location bookmarks](../../incident-reporting/location-bookmarks.md) to quickly and easily set the location on an activity
* If you have added [tags](../tags/) to your account you will be able to select them at the bottom of the basic page

### Attendance Type

The attendance type field allows you to specify whether or not you want all team members to be invited to the activity

* Selecting Full-Team Incident invites all team members to the activity. New team members will automatically be invited to future full-team activities
