# Activities

[Incidents](../../incident-reporting/incident-reports.md), [Exercises and Events](../../personnel-and-training/exercises-and-events/) are all called activities within D4H.&#x20;

### Exercises

Build a schedule of pre-planned training exercises and request [personnel](../../incident-management/personnel/) to attend and collect their responses in real-time. Training exercises are directly comparable with [D4H Incident Reporting](../../incident-reporting/getting-started.md) entries so you can compare training versus your responses by [resources](../resources/), [tags](../tags/), attendance, and more.

### Events

Log activities such as meetings, maintenance, public events, and any other activities on your activities [calendar](../../personnel-and-training/calendar/). Request attendance and collect attendance responses in real-time and compile [reports](../reports/) which can then be published for your records.

### Incidents

Automatically generate insightful [incident reports ](../../incident-reporting/incident-reports.md)with [Charts](../charts/), visualizations, and statistics. Access game-changing data to re-evaluate operations, make better decisions, and demonstrate the value of your organization to donors.
