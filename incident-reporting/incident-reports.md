# Incident Reports

Automatically generate insightful incident reports with [Charts](../shared-services/charts/), visualizations, and statistics. Access game-changing data to re-evaluate operations, make better decisions, and demonstrate the value of your organization to donors.  
  
Create a common reporting format to ensure that the same fields are being filled in every time. By creating common formats you may easily report and measure your incidents. To help you format your report you can create your own [custom timestamps](incident-timestamps/) and [custom fields](../shared-services/custom-fields/).
