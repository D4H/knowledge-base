# Lost Person Behavior

Approved as an International Search and Rescue Incident Database (ISRID) Silver compatible data source, you can single-click to export all lost person behavior statistics for submission to the international databases.

The better the data, the more knowledge and understanding, the better the decisions. Data changes over time and new trends develop. For this reason ISRID must be updated and grow.

The goal is better data, new subject categories, more regional data approaches, better survivability analysis and so on. This will be used to update the Lost Person Behavior book and app. D4H collects some data that truly helps ISRID spatial and survival models.
