# Sample Templates



A Status Board is a visualization of information within Incident Management. It is comprised of a set of rows, much like a spreadsheet, with a configurable form behind each row. Each Status Board has a Template which outlines the layout of the form behind it and which columns should display on the list view.  
The following sample templates are available to be used in your account. To get started, click on one of the templates below and follow the directions on our sample template upload guide.
